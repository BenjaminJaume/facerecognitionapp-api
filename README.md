# Face Recognition App - API

This is the Back End side of the [Face Recognition App](https://github.com/BenjaminJaume/facerecognitionapp).

I created it while following the corresponding course on Udemy: [The Complete Web Developer in 2020: Zero to Mastery](https://www.udemy.com/course/the-complete-web-developer-zero-to-mastery/)



## What it does

This part of the app receive the picture's link and upload it to the [Clarifai API](https://www.clarifai.com/). It returns the area that should be highlighted around the detected faces. It also handle a __PostgreSQL__ database connection that allow user's to authentificate on the platform.

## Express Server

It is basically an Express server, and it handles differents routes depending on the need of the Front End app.

## Conclusion

It is a complete __Full Stack Developer__ course. So I gained a lot of experience while coding and setting up the app.
